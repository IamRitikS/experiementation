#### Form 1

I picked up this challenge from reddit. Someone posted a video while flexing this from. I liked the design and recreated it only using HTML + CSS and Vanilla Javascript
P.S. - If you type "mark" in username and password during login, it shows picture of Mark zuckerberg. Implement it using JQuery in your Log-in form
